# Next-Word-Prediction-Language-Modelling

Next Word Prediction (also called Language Modeling) is the task of predicting what word comes next. It is one of the fundamental tasks of NLP.

## Description

We always use this language modelling in our routine life. For example, **Mobile keyboard text recommendation** or **Whenever we search for something on any search engine, we get many suggestions and, as we type new words in it, we get better recommendations according to our searching context.** So, how will it happen???

Answer is, It is poosible through **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. Here, we will use NLP and try to make a prediction model using **Bidirectional LSTM (Long short-term memory) Model** that will predict next words of sentence.
